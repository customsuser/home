<p><strong>In November last year, there were rumors that Lionel Scaloni will soon leave the responsibility of the Argentina national team. In December, ESPN reported that this coach will not be seen in Argentina&#8217;s dugout after the Copa America.</strong><strong>This World Cup winning coach has dismissed these rumours. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an interview given to Sky Sports, Scaloni said it was not a farewell. He said not to think about these things now and to continue as a coach in the future. Scaloni commented, &#8216;I&#8217;ve always said it&#8217;s time to stop and think. It wasn&#8217;t goodbye. There were only reflections of that moment. Now we must continue. &#8216;</p>



<p>Earlier, Scaloni hinted at leaving the team after last year&#8217;s 1-0 win over Brazil at the Maracana. He told the service to think about what to do next. Scaloni commented, &#8216;One important thing is to stop the ball and think. There are many things to think about at this time. These footballers have given me a lot. They have given a lot to the entire coaching staff. But now I have to think. I have to think about what I will do. &#8216;</p>



<p>However, this coach withdrew from this thinking. That is, even after the Copa America, he will be seen in the dugout of Argentina.</p>



<p>After winning the World Cup in Qatar, Scaloni signed a new contract with the Argentine Football Association. The 45-year-old coach has been given the responsibility of the dugout till the 2026 World Cup. According to his words, it can be said that this World Cup-winning coach will be in charge of Argentina in the next World Cup as well.</p>
