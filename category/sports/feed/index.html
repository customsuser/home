<p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo is injured. That&#8217;s why Al Nasr announced the suspension of their two matches in the China tour yesterday.</strong><strong>However, Chinese football fans could not accept this. They expressed their anger in front of the team hotel of the Saudi club. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The first match was scheduled to take place today in Shenzhen. The second match was scheduled four days later. The news of Ronaldo&#8217;s injury became known only yesterday. Although the details are not known exactly how long this Portuguese star will be out of the field. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ronaldo regretted not being able to go to China due to injury. He said, &#8216;Today is a difficult day for me. I want to apologize to the Chinese fans, especially the people of Shenzhen. You know, in football, many things are often out of control. Been playing professional football for 22 years, but never been injured too much. I am sorry that Al Nasr and I came to China to enjoy the tour. &#8216;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on February 1, Inter Miami and Al Nasr are scheduled to meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Many people are waiting for this match to see Messi-Ronaldo duel. However, due to Ronaldo&#8217;s injury, there is concern about the two stars being seen together.</p>
