<p><strong>Although they conceded the goal in the beginning, Barcelona turned around later. They go forward.</strong><strong>However, the gap could not be maintained for long. Athletic Bilbao equalized after the break and the match went into extra time after no more goals. The team played there. Twice the ball into Barca&#8217;s net confirmed the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey.</strong></p>



<p>Bilbao beat Barcelona 4-2 in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals at San Mames last night. Lewandowski equalized for the visitors after Gorka scored for the club. After a while they were led by Lamine Yamal. Inaki Williams and Nico Williams scored two goals in extra time after Oihan Sunset equalized for Bilbao in the first half.</p>



<p>Bilbao went ahead at the beginning because of the mistake of the opponent in the home field. The hosts attack from the left with the ball lost in control. No one from Barca could clear the ball despite having the opportunity. Gorka found the net with a half volley from the box. In the 22nd minute, Barca defender Alejandro Balde was injured and left the field with tears in his eyes.</p>



<p>Barca equalized in the 26th minute. The ball ricocheted off Lewandowski and into the back of the net. Barca took the lead six minutes later by Yamal. He caught a pass from Jul Kunder and found the net with a great shot from outside the box. If there are no more goals in the first half, Barca will go into the break ahead.</p>



<p>Bilbao equalized in the fourth minute after the break. Sunset equalized with a header from a Nico Williams cross. Both teams then tried to advance but failed. The match goes to extra time. Inaki Williams made the gap there. A teammate&#8217;s pass from the box failed initially but was successful on the return shot. Bilbao secured the win with another goal in added time. Nico sends the ball into the net from inside the box. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In November last year, there were rumors that Lionel Scaloni will soon leave the responsibility of the Argentina national team. In December, ESPN reported that this coach will not be seen in Argentina&#8217;s dugout after the Copa America.</strong><strong>This World Cup winning coach has dismissed these rumours. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an interview given to Sky Sports, Scaloni said it was not a farewell. He said not to think about these things now and to continue as a coach in the future. Scaloni commented, &#8216;I&#8217;ve always said it&#8217;s time to stop and think. It wasn&#8217;t goodbye. There were only reflections of that moment. Now we must continue. &#8216;</p>



<p>Earlier, Scaloni hinted at leaving the team after last year&#8217;s 1-0 win over Brazil at the Maracana. He told the service to think about what to do next. Scaloni commented, &#8216;One important thing is to stop the ball and think. There are many things to think about at this time. These footballers have given me a lot. They have given a lot to the entire coaching staff. But now I have to think. I have to think about what I will do. &#8216;</p>



<p>However, this coach withdrew from this thinking. That is, even after the Copa America, he will be seen in the dugout of Argentina.</p>



<p>After winning the World Cup in Qatar, Scaloni signed a new contract with the Argentine Football Association. The 45-year-old coach has been given the responsibility of the dugout till the 2026 World Cup. According to his words, it can be said that this World Cup-winning coach will be in charge of Argentina in the next World Cup as well.</p>

<p><strong>Bashundhara Kings&#8217; Uzbek midfielder Asror Gafurov was shown a red card in the first half of the last match against Odisha FC in the AFC Cup on December 11 last year. That red card had an impact on the match, Bashundhara had to withdraw from the group stage for the third time in a row.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are questions about how much of a red-card offense Ghafurov committed on Odisha&#8217;s Moroccan midfielder Ahmed Zahu. But Gafurov has been banned for two matches by the AFC Disciplinary Committee for this crime. Also, the Uzbek midfielder will have to pay a fine of 1000 dollars or 100,000 taka. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After the 10-man loss to Odisha, Kings coach Oscar Brujon was unreservedly critical of the referee at a press conference. Bruzon was at risk of a ban or fine after so openly criticizing the referee in that December 11 match. However, the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) did not take any action against him. However, they considered the crime of Uzbek footballer Asor Gafurov serious. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee meeting on January 15 was announced on the organization&#8217;s website. That said, Gafurov fouled very hard from behind, which is a very serious foul. According to section 38.2.3 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Policy, Gafurov will be banned for 2 matches in any AFC competition. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo is injured. That&#8217;s why Al Nasr announced the suspension of their two matches in the China tour yesterday.</strong><strong>However, Chinese football fans could not accept this. They expressed their anger in front of the team hotel of the Saudi club. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The first match was scheduled to take place today in Shenzhen. The second match was scheduled four days later. The news of Ronaldo&#8217;s injury became known only yesterday. Although the details are not known exactly how long this Portuguese star will be out of the field. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ronaldo regretted not being able to go to China due to injury. He said, &#8216;Today is a difficult day for me. I want to apologize to the Chinese fans, especially the people of Shenzhen. You know, in football, many things are often out of control. Been playing professional football for 22 years, but never been injured too much. I am sorry that Al Nasr and I came to China to enjoy the tour. &#8216;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on February 1, Inter Miami and Al Nasr are scheduled to meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Many people are waiting for this match to see Messi-Ronaldo duel. However, due to Ronaldo&#8217;s injury, there is concern about the two stars being seen together.</p>
