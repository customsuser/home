He told the service to think about what to do next. Scaloni commented, &#8216;One important thing is to stop the ball and think. There are many things to think about at this time. These footballers have given me a lot. They have given a lot to the entire coaching staff. But now I have to think. I have to think about what I will do. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this coach withdrew from this thinking.
