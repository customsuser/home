<p><strong>Although they conceded the goal in the beginning, Barcelona turned around later. They go forward.</strong><strong>However, the gap could not be maintained for long. Athletic Bilbao equalized after the break and the match went into extra time after no more goals. The team played there. Twice the ball into Barca&#8217;s net confirmed the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey.</strong></p>



<p>Bilbao beat Barcelona 4-2 in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals at San Mames last night. Lewandowski equalized for the visitors after Gorka scored for the club. After a while they were led by Lamine Yamal. Inaki Williams and Nico Williams scored two goals in extra time after Oihan Sunset equalized for Bilbao in the first half.</p>



<p>Bilbao went ahead at the beginning because of the mistake of the opponent in the home field. The hosts attack from the left with the ball lost in control. No one from Barca could clear the ball despite having the opportunity. Gorka found the net with a half volley from the box. In the 22nd minute, Barca defender Alejandro Balde was injured and left the field with tears in his eyes.</p>



<p>Barca equalized in the 26th minute. The ball ricocheted off Lewandowski and into the back of the net. Barca took the lead six minutes later by Yamal. He caught a pass from Jul Kunder and found the net with a great shot from outside the box. If there are no more goals in the first half, Barca will go into the break ahead.</p>



<p>Bilbao equalized in the fourth minute after the break. Sunset equalized with a header from a Nico Williams cross. Both teams then tried to advance but failed. The match goes to extra time. Inaki Williams made the gap there. A teammate&#8217;s pass from the box failed initially but was successful on the return shot. Bilbao secured the win with another goal in added time. Nico sends the ball into the net from inside the box. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bashundhara Kings&#8217; Uzbek midfielder Asror Gafurov was shown a red card in the first half of the last match against Odisha FC in the AFC Cup on December 11 last year. That red card had an impact on the match, Bashundhara had to withdraw from the group stage for the third time in a row.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are questions about how much of a red-card offense Ghafurov committed on Odisha&#8217;s Moroccan midfielder Ahmed Zahu. But Gafurov has been banned for two matches by the AFC Disciplinary Committee for this crime. Also, the Uzbek midfielder will have to pay a fine of 1000 dollars or 100,000 taka. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After the 10-man loss to Odisha, Kings coach Oscar Brujon was unreservedly critical of the referee at a press conference. Bruzon was at risk of a ban or fine after so openly criticizing the referee in that December 11 match. However, the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) did not take any action against him. However, they considered the crime of Uzbek footballer Asor Gafurov serious. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee meeting on January 15 was announced on the organization&#8217;s website. That said, Gafurov fouled very hard from behind, which is a very serious foul. According to section 38.2.3 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Policy, Gafurov will be banned for 2 matches in any AFC competition. &nbsp;</p>
